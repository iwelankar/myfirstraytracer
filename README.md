Features

Realistic Materials
Lambertian (matte) surfaces with accurate light scattering
Metallic materials with configurable fuzziness
Dielectric (glass) materials with refraction

Advanced Camera System
Adjustable field of view and focus
Depth of field effects
Anti-aliasing through supersampling

Physical Light Simulation
Accurate ray bouncing and light transport
Gamma correction for realistic color output
Configurable ray depth for performance tuning

Building

Clone this repository
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio
Build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B)
Navigate to the Debug folder in command prompt

Running
bash# Navigate to debug folder
cd "path/to/project/x64/Debug"

# Render an image
myfirstraytracer.exe > image.ppm

# View progress in real-time
